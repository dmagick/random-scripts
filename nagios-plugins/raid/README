The script will return critical if the raid is broken (disk missing) or using a spare disk. It will return a warning if it's rebuilding/resyncing.

Anything else apart from "OK" should return 'unknown' and the script should be updated to handle that situation.

Currently it supports

    * hp
    * dell
    * 3ware (at least for degraded/rebuilding arrays)
    * mdadm 

It uses the proprietary binaries from hp/dell/3ware to do the work. If they aren't installed, you can't check the raid status.

If you are checking a 3ware controller, the 3ware utils require root access. However nagios runs as nrpe (centos) or nagios (debian) so you need to set up sudo access:

nrpe    ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/local/sbin/tw_cli

and disable 'disable requiretty':

Defaults    requiretty
Defaults:nrpe !requiretty

Then test it:

# sudo -u nrpe sudo /usr/local/sbin/tw_cli /c0 show

In your nrpe config (for centos/rhel this will need adjusting based on the architecture since they get installed to different locations):

64 bit
command[check_raid]=/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/check_raid.pl

or 32 bit
command[check_raid]=/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_raid.pl

Your nagios commands.cfg :

define command{
     command_name    check-raid
     command_line       /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_nrpe -H $HOSTADDRESS$ -t 30 -c check_raid
}

and of course your  services.cfg :

define service {
    name check-raid
    description check-raid
    use workhours-service
    check_command check-raid
    hosts a, b, c
}

There are no warnings or thresholds to pass through.
